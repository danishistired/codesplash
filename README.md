# codesplash README

CodeSplash is a Visual Studio Code extension that lets you instantly share your project as a runnable environment. With one click, it zips your code, uploads it to GoFile.io, and generates a shareable link. The recipient can paste the link into the extension to automatically download, unzip, open the folder in VS Code, and install all required dependencies.

No Git, no Drive uploads, no setup instructions ‚Äî just splash the code and go.
